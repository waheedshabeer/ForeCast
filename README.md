# React Weather Forecasting App

This is a simple weather forecasting React application that allows users to view the current weather of the day and the weather forecast for the next 7 days. The app features a landing page that displays weather information retrieved from a live weather API. Additional pages can be added for navigation and more detailed daily weather information.

## Getting Started

Before running the app, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-weather-forecast-app.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd react-weather-forecast-app
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can access it in your web browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of the React app.
  - `components/`: React components used in the app.
  - `pages/`: Additional pages can be added here.
  - `services/`: API integration and other services.
- `public/`: Static assets and the `index.html` file.

## Usage

The app displays the current weather on the landing page. Users can navigate to other pages to view more detailed daily weather information.

Feel free to customize the app according to your preferences and requirements.

## API Integration

This app relies on a live weather API to fetch weather data. The API integration can be found in the `src/services` directory. To replace the default API with your own, you can edit the corresponding service file and update the API endpoints and keys as needed.

For the initial setup, this project uses [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). You will need to sign up for a free API key from their website to use this service.

## Adding Additional Pages

You can add new pages to the app by creating React components in the `src/pages/` directory. Make sure to update the routing in `src/App.js` to navigate to your new pages.
